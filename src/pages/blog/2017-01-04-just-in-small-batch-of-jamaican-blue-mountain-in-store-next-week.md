# WHAT’S AHEAD IN THE BRITISH PROPERTY MARKET IN 2020?

2020 IS LOOMING, AND THE BRITISH PROPERTY MARKET EXPERTS ARE MAKING THEIR FORECASTS FOR THE YEAR AHEAD, INCLUDING PRICES AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS.

Much of the focus is on how much house prices might rise by. But other factors will help shape decisions on whether to buy or sell a home in the next 12 months.

We take a look at what might lie ahead in the property market.

### Brexit’s Will-We-Won’t-We Question Settled

The uncertainty in UK politics has been removed with the Conservatives’ thumping general election victory.

But the spectre of Brexit – the UK’s departure from the European Union – has had the greatest effect on the property market.

Before the EU referendum in June 2016, house prices[rose on average](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-7802771/Will-Boris-Bounce-spark-house-price-fireworks.html)by 8 percent every year. By September 2019, however, the rate had dropped to 1.3 percent.

With a new government in place with a strong majority, the will-we-won’t-we nature of Brexit is over. The UK is likely to depart the EU on January 31.

Therefore, the certainty of our departure should give homeowners and home buyers more confidence in planning a move.

### House Price Bounce?

Rightmove is among the estate agents predicting bigger house price gains in the property market in 2020.

The online property portal is[forecasting a 2 percent rise in prices](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/news/articles/property-news/house-price-index-2020-forecast-price-rise-increase). It’s also forecasting more properties coming on to the market. One side effect of the Brexit uncertainty was a drop in supply as homeowners decided to sit tight.

That could all change in the coming weeks and months, making spring in particular a boom time for buyers and sellers.
